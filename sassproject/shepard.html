        <p>My other favorite type of dog is the german shepard. Similar to huskies, I always felt they looked strong and regal and they seemed like they would be very loyal companions.</p>
        <h2>Very Intelligent Partners</h2>

        <p class="hometext">The reason this breed always seemed loyal to me is through their excessive use in the police force and army. I believe that german shepards are supposed to be considered one of the smartest dog breeds, which makes sense if they are being chosen to help with such important professions.</p>
